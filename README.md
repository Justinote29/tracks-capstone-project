# tracks-capstone-project
bootcamp group project-  I worked on the audio recorder to create and play tracks, saving the audio to s3, and updating profile information.  I also worked on the backend routes to save data to MongoDB and s3.

React app with CRUD functionality.

Users can create an audio track.  This is any connections they have to physical space: a memory, experience, thought, review, etc.  This track is then displayed on a map and tied to the geolocation where it was created.  The tracks is then able to be played by other users on a shared map.  A user can also access their tracks on a separate page and delete them.  Additionally, a user can update their username and profile picture.
